blackout, later Support and FAQ

How do I install the app?
Search "blackout, later" in the Apple App Store

How do I start counting drinks?
Open the app.
If you see a screen with a number picker, scroll to the number you want. Then press the blue button under the picker.
If you see a screen with a fraction, you are already counting drinks.

How do I start a new session?
If you are on the drink counting screen (a colored background with a large fraction number), press the "blackout, later" in the top left of the screen.
You can also stop the app from the multitasker and then open it again to view the drink picker home screen.

Why does the background change colors?
The colors are meant to provide an easy way to check your drinking progress, like a guide.
If you see orange or red, just remember that you aren't doing anything wrong -- the app is just suggesting you to start taking a little extra care.

What is the table that appears at the bottom of the counting screen?
The table is meant to make it easier to pace your drinking.
The left column represents your drinks with a number.
The middle column shows what time that drink was drank (or, when the Plus button was pressed on that screen).
The rightmost column shows how much time passed between each drink, in minutes.
